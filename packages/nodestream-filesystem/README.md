> Local filesystem adapter for [Nodestream][nodestream-url]

**Identity:** `filesystem`

[**API docs**][apidocs-url]

## Description

This adapter provides interface for Nodestream to transfer bytes between your app and the local filesystem storage on which the app runs.

## Usage

### Installation

`npm install --save nodestream-filesystem`

### Configuration

This adapter has only one confuguration option - `root` - a path to a folder where Nodestream should expect to find/write your files to. If you do not provide this option, then Nodestream will try its best to determine that path for you:

- By checking the presence of `require.main` and using it
- By using the current working directory

In all these default cases, the target folder will be named *.storage*. If it does not exist, it will be created on first write.

> **Even with these defaults, you should always explicitly state where Nodestream should put your files**. It's the only way to guarantee that you will not spend hours searching through your project's files trying to figure out where the hell did that file go. ðŸ˜€

```js
const Nodestream = require('nodestream')
const nodestream = new Nodestream({
  adapter: 'filesystem',
  config: {
    // You MUST provide either an absolute path or nothing at all
    // You can use array notation, the parts will be `path.join()`ed for you
    root: [__dirname, '.storage']
  }
})
```
